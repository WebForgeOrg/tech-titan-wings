WEBFORGE: TECH TITANS WINGS
BY: CHANCE DAIGLE, RYAN LEBATO, ARBIN SHRESTHA, NATHAN GUIDRY

WEB STRUCTURE:
--------------
The web structure for this website follows that of a traditional chicken wing ecommerce website. There contains a home page,
contact page, menu page, locations page, menu page, and cart page-- all created via html, css, and javascript. Plans to implement
SQL Server and PHP are in place to complete the initial cart functionality presented in this website's first front-end prototype.

WCAG STANDARDS:
--------------
The WCAG Standard we've chosen to focus on is "Understandable", where information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
We've accomplished this by following industry standard web structures so as to familiarize the user, used common modern language, made self-
explanatory buttons with sufficient labels that indicate their functions, and added visual aids in the form of pictures to accompany any
product descriptions.

WEB HOST:
--------------
The web host we've chosen to utilize is netlify. Netlify is a remote-first cloud computing company that offers a development platform 
that includes build, deploy, and serverless backend services for web applications and dynamic websites. This was a perfect choice for our
business since it offers scalability and seamless connections with SQL Server and PHP, which will be implemented for the second benchmark 
of the website. Not to mention that it is free to begin, and has cheap rates for when our website begins to gain traction. For now, it is
great for our use in testing our product online.
